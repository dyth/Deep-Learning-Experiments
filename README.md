# Deep Learning Experiments

* `feedforwardnetwork.py` is a simple multilayer perceptron and is run by `python feedforwardnetwork.py -a 3072,768,384,2 -d path/to/dataset`, where -a, the architecture settings denote the number of neurons per layer.
* `kerasMultiPerceptron.py` implements a single layered network which classifies data created by on `createData.py`
